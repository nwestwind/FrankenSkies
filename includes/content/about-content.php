		<p>First the Truth will upset you, but then it will set you Free.</p>
		<p>I never thought I would be an activist but I guess that's life, one door closes another door opens. For me I'd worked so many different jobs and spent so much of my life in a classroom that I just wanted to get grounded and learn about growing food. I worked on a farm and there I opened my eyes for the first time to the FrakenSkies we never knew. From the day I realized something abnormal was occurring in our skies, I was driven to do something about it. Through my devotion and passion I've realized incredible traction via social media. My goal is very simple, it is unity. Truth is all embracing and our strength comes from this bond we all share. </p>
